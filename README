WXMAXIMA
=========

wxMaxima is an interface for the computer algebra system maxima. For more
information about maxima, go to

  http://maxima.sourceforge.net/

wxMaxima can be found at

  http://wxmaxima.sourceforge.net/

wxMaxima uses wxWidgets and runs natively on Linux and Windows. It
provides nicely formatted display of maxima output.

wxMaxima requires maxima version 5.9.1.



LICENCE
========

wxMaxima is licenced under GPL. See the file COPYING.



INSTALLATION
=============


BINARY INSTALLATION
--------------------

Binaries for Linux and Windows are provided at wxMaxima homepage. They do
not need wxWidgets to be installed on your computer.

Windows binaries come with an installer. You should install wxMaxima in a
subdirectory of maxima installation directory (see section
CONFIGURATION). The Linux rpm is compiled on Fedora Core 3. Binaries
for some other distributions are contributed by wxMaxima users and are
available from the download section of wxMaxima homepage.


SOURCE INSTALLATION
--------------------

** Linux

Download and install wxWidgets library from

  http://www.wxwidgets.org/

I recommend the development version 2.5.3. Go to the source directory and do

  ./configure
  make
  make install

wxMaxima also requires libxml2 to be installed on your system. libxml2 comes
with most distributions, make sure you have the development packages
installed.

** Windows 
   
I build the windows binaries using Dev-CPP. Dev-CPP can be downloaded from

  http://www.bloodshed.net

You will also need to install the wxWidgets and libxml2 devpacks (and their
dependencies), which can also be found at the web-page. In Dev-CPP create a new
wxWidgets project, add libxml2 and other required libraries to the project and
import all the sources of wxMaxima.



CONFIGURATION
==============


** Linux

wxMaxima does not need any configuration if maxima is in your path. If not,
configure wxMaxima with Maxima->Configure.

** Windows

To automatically configure wxMaxima, wxMaxima must be installed in a
subdirectory of maxima installation directory. For example:

  maxima installation:   C:\Program Files\maxima-5.9.1
  wxMaxima installation: C:\Program Files\maxima-5.9.1\wxMaxima

If you install in some other directory, you must configure wxMaxima with
Maxima->Configure.

=========


** Linux
