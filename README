WXMAXIMA
=========

wxMaxima is an interface for the computer algebra system maxima. For more
information about maxima, go to

  http://maxima.sourceforge.net/

wxMaxima can be found at

  http://wxmaxima.sourceforge.net/

wxMaxima uses wxWidgets and runs natively on Linux and Windows. It
provides nicely formatted display of maxima output.

wxMaxima requires maxima version 5.9.1.



LICENCE
========

wxMaxima is licenced under GPL. See the file COPYING.



INSTALLATION
=============


BINARY INSTALLATION
--------------------

Binaries for Linux and Windows are provided at wxMaxima homepage. They do
not need wxWidgets to be installed on your computer.

Windows binaries come with an installer. You should install wxMaxima in a
subdirectory of maxima installation directory (see section
CONFIGURATION). The Linux rpm is compiled on Fedora Core 3. Binaries
for some other distributions are contributed by wxMaxima users and are
available from the download section of wxMaxima homepage.


SOURCE INSTALLATION
--------------------

** Linux

Download and install wxWidgets library from

  http://www.wxwidgets.org/

I recommend the development version 2.5.3. Go to the source directory and do

  ./configure
  make
  make install

wxMaxima also requires libxml2 to be installed on your system. libxml2 comes
with most distributions, make sure you have the development packages
installed.

** Windows 
   
I build the windows binaries using Dev-CPP. Dev-CPP can be downloaded from

  http://www.bloodshed.net

You will also need to install the wxWidgets and libxml2 devpacks (and their
dependencies), which can also be found at the web-page. In Dev-CPP create a new
wxWidgets project, add libxml2 and other required libraries to the project and
import all the sources of wxMaxima.

** Building from CVS (Linux)

To build wxMaxima from CVS, first checkout the CVS tree. For details see

  http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=126731

Then build wxMaxima with

  ./bootstrap
  ./configure
  make
  make install



CONFIGURATION
==============


** Linux

wxMaxima does not need any configuration if maxima is in your path. If not,
configure wxMaxima with Maxima->Configure.

** Windows

To automatically configure wxMaxima, wxMaxima must be installed in a
subdirectory of maxima installation directory. For example:

  maxima installation:   C:\Program Files\maxima-5.9.1
  wxMaxima installation: C:\Program Files\maxima-5.9.1\wxMaxima

If you install in some other directory, you must configure wxMaxima with
Maxima->Configure.



PRINTING
=========


** Linux

The default Postscript driver used for printing on Linux can not print wxMaxima
session properly (it has problems in finding out how much space is needed to
print a string).

Starting with version 2.5.4 wxGTK can be compiled with support for libgnomeprint
(and libgnomeprintui) which has much better support for printing. Using this
driver, wxMaxima can print correctly. So printing on Linux is only available if
wxGTK has been compiled with support for libgnomeprint and libgnomeprint is
found when wxMaxima is started.



GREEK CHARACTERS
=================

wxMaxima can display greek characters if apropriate font is installed on your
system. Two kind of fonts can be used:

 o fonts in WinGreek/ISO8859-7 encoding (most fonts on MS Windows have this
   encoding)
 o special symbol fonts (fonts which map latin characters to greek characters,
   compatible the Symbol font on MS Windows).

The first method should be used on MS Windows and wxGTK1 (you may need to install
some iso8859-7 fonts). The second method should be used on wxGTK2.

Some TTF fonts, which are compatible with the Symbol font:

 o BSTGreek(*) : http://www.biblestudytools.net/OtherResources/BSTFonts/
 o GreekFP     : http://www.paradigm-sw.com/gfp/font.htm
 o Galilee(**) : http://faculty.bbc.edu/rdecker/galilee.htm

To install the fonts on Linux, you can usually put them in $HOME/.fonts directory.

(*)  You can extract the font from the exe file using unzip on Linux.
(**) Download the old version, not the unicode one.


UPDATING
=========


** Linux

When you update maxima or wxMaxima, you should delete the file .wxMaxima in
your home directory.

** Windows

To update maxima or wxMaxima, you should:
 - uninstall wxMaxima
 - uninstall maxima (if updating maxima)
 - install maxima   (if updating maxima)
 - install wxMaxima (in a subdirectory of maxima, see section CONFIGURATION)
